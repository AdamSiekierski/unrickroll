## What's this thing?

It's a simple web extension, that prevents you from accidentally getting Rick-rolled. Simply speaking - when you're about to open a page with Rick Astley's "Never gonna give you up", you'll be first shown a [warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) about what's going to happen.

## How's it made?

The extension is made mainly using those technologies:

- Webpack - for creating the required extension JS scripts
- TypeScript - who uses JavaScript in 2021?
- WebExtension API along with its [polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)
